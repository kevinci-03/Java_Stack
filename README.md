# Kevin Cisneros-Cuevas

Stack:
This project is an implementation of my StackArray and StackNodeList implementations in Python
while I was in my CPE 202 - Data Structures class.

Skills Used:
- I was able to implement an efficient Stack using my knowledge of the Data Structure
- I was able to learn Java on my own time during the summer and translate my python code to Java
- I was able to get associated with JUnit testing
